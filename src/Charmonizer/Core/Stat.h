/* Charmonizer/Core/Stat.h - stat a file, if possible.
 *
 * This component works by attempting to compile a utility program called
 * "_charm_stat".  When Charmonizer needs to stat a file, it shells out to
 * this utility, which communicates via a file a la capture_output().
 *
 * Since we don't know whether we have 64-bit integers when Charmonizer itself
 * gets compiled, the items in the stat structure are whatever size longs are.
 * 
 * TODO: probe for which fields are available.
