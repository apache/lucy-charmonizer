 * Since Charmonizer conditionally defines many symbols, it can be difficult
 * to tell whether a symbol is missing because it should not have been
 * generated, or whether it is missing because an error occurred.  These test
 * functions make the assumption that any missing symbols have a good excuse
 * for their absence, and test only defined symbols.  This may result in
 * undetected failure some of the time.  However, missing symbols required by
 * your application will trigger compile-time errors, so the theoretical
 * problem of silent failure is less severe than it appears, affecting only
 * fallbacks.
