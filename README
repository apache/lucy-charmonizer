NAME

    Charmonizer - write portable C header files

SYNOPSIS

    #include "Charmonizer.h"
    #include "Charmonizer/Modules/Integers.h"
    #include "Charmonizer/Modules/LargeFiles.h"

    int main() {
        /* open and begin config file */
        FILE *config_fh = fopen("myconf.h", "w");
        if (config_fh == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error opening myconf.h\n")
            exit(1);
        }
        printf(config_fh, "/* Auto-generated file - do not edit!! */\n\n");
        
        /* set up Charmonizer */
        chaz_init("darwin", "cc", "-I/usr/local/include");
        
        /* run desired Charmonizer modules */
        chaz_Integers_run(config_fh);
        chaz_LargeFiles_run(config_fh);

        /* tear down Charmonizer */
        chaz_clean_up();

        return 0;
    }

DESCRIPTION

    Charmonizer is a tool for writing portable C header files.  It works by
    attempting to compile lots of little programs and analyzing the output
    from those that build successfully.  It is intended to work with any ISO
    C90-compilant compiler and (eventually) on any operating system, without
    requiring a specific shell.

    Charmonizer is organized as one central library, "Charmonizer.h", and a
    suite of topically oriented modules, e.g. LargeFiles, Integers.  Each
    module exports 1 primary function, ModuleName_run(FILE* conf_fh), which
    appends its output to a supplied file handle. Your config file gets built
    up bit by bit as you run each module in turn.

    The config file can be further customized either by writing your own data
    to it or possibly by setting options which affect the behavior of the
    modules.

FILESYSTEM NAMESPACE

    Charmonizer creates a number of files within the current working directory
    while it runs.  These files all begin with "_charm".

METAQUOTE UTILITY

    Charmonizer is (more or less) a C program which writes C code.  Writing C
    from C is ordinarily quite awkward, because when you try to embed more
    than a line or two of C source code inside C string literals, things get
    ugly fast.  

    To get around this problem, Charmonizer uses a source filter.  In the
    "real" Charmonizer source code, longer code fragments are surrounded by
    METAQUOTE tags instead of literal double quotes.  
    
        char hello_source[] = METAQUOTE
            #include <stdio.h>
            int main() { 
                printf("Hello, world.\n");
                return 0;
            }
        METAQUOTE;

    These source files are run through the "metaquote" utility -- which
    transforms everything between paired METAQUOTE tags into concatenated
    string literals.  The result is hideous but valid C.
